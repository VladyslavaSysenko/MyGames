# MY GAMES
## Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/1cfEG5iaJcY>
## Description:

My CS50 final progect is **MY GAMES** for board games enthusiasts :)

It is a web-based application using JavaScript, Python, and SQL.

I love board games but I have bad memory, so with time I always forget my impression about played games.

That is why i decided to make a website where you can add board games in which you played with review, rating, belonging, price, picture and date. You can also sort them the way you want. All memories are collected in one place!
In addition, you can also choose a first player or make a random order of players.
Lastly, you can see websites where you can search for new interesting games all together.
